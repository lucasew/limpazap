## 2024-08-14 - Incomplete File Discovery Due to Single Storage Assumption
**Vulnerability:** The application was only scanning the primary external storage directory for WhatsApp backups by using `getExternalStorageDirectory()`. On devices with multiple storage volumes (e.g., an SD card), this could result in backup files on other storage locations not being discovered or deleted.
**Learning:** Assuming a single external storage location can lead to incomplete data handling and potential data remnants. For security-sensitive operations like cleaning user data, it's critical to account for all possible file locations.
**Prevention:** Always use `getExternalStorageDirectories()` when an application needs to scan for or manage files that could exist on multiple storage volumes. This ensures a comprehensive search and prevents data from being missed.
